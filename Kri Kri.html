     <p><b>Let's take a trip down the memory lane</b></p>
    

      
      <p>I met Ewura Abena in an animal biology practical class on Wednesday, the 26th of February. Me i was sitting my somewhere and this nigerian-looking girl came to me and was like she wants to copy my work. I was taken aback because ah? So we dey do things? She was even fanfooling me that my sea fan is nice...this liar. One thing led to another and alluvasudden, this girl said she'll take my number so i don't "misplace" her book.
         Like ei! So yeah i submitted the books and blah blah blah, then this girl texted me and asked me if i've submitted the books..(Like how distrusting can you be?) Next morning, someone is calling me. I got up, from my <b>SLEEP!</b> only to see that it was Kri calling me. I picked and then she said i should help her out with her chem lab report. She called me like 10 times...and i'm not even joking. Lemme even show you proof (as she would say)<img src="proof.jpg" height="200" width="200" > 
         .Ps :The "prima delirante" means delusional cousin, not first delirium or whatever thing you said. Anyway,</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Her Favorite Things ðŸŽ¨</h2>
    Hmm..."Eww"ra Abena...does she even have favorites??
    Well for starters i know Lavender is her favourite colour and that she watches nothing else apart from Grey's anatomy and Little Demon
    <ul>
      <li><u>Reading?</u> That two by four thing that she calls reading...I'm joking oo. She actually does read, always going on with her Dan Brown, Robert Langdon and what what conspiracy this that. She's still on the first page of the foreword of Crime And Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky, book that she bought with her own money.</li>
      <br>
      <li><u>Dancing??</u> Oh Good Heavens...Hell NO! She forces oo but then hmmm...well Proverbs 23:7 says that as a man thinketh himself be, so is he. Let's just give her the credit for that i guess. </li>
      <br>
      <li><u>Food? </u>Oh yes, a foodie, a glutton...if she gets grilled chicken, salad and Coke, i'll never hear the end of it. I bet you could even kidnap her with it. 3na <b>"life is good, life is good"</b>. Later she'll come and say "God Abeg", which she has surprisingly stopped saying, or </li>
      <br>
      <li><u>Undermining herself?</u> Yes please. That one dierr give her a Crown made of all the finest things it could possibly be made of because ei!The crown kraa add gold medals and put her name in the guineass book of records on top ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­It's not good o...But then it has actually become better and she's changing. I think i played a part in that due to the fact that i <b>broached</b> the topic ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ </li>
      <br>
      <li><u>Games?</u> AwooðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ She'll look at you like you're a mad person. Like she has never heard the word before and it's foreign and abstract to her, which it actually isðŸ˜­. Ask her to name a game character to save her life and she won't be able to (even though the prospect of death is welcoming to her. Gyimiii, you never see anything yet). It's a guaranteed death sentence. </li>
      <br>
      <li><u>Snapchat? Instagram?</u> Oh you've got her hooked completely. Ranging from reels to Snapchat stories of King Charles the third(yes i know i'm wrong), Sikaofficial and the rest of her online gist partners, she just won't stop talking about them. Again, you could kidnap her while she's watching and she wouldn't realize. <u>Ps:</u> you could also hide crucial information by saying it on her Whatsapp groups. Trust me, she would never know. Apparently, that applies to Whatsapp Statuses too, even that of her own sweet and wonderful cousin. This is a topic for another day. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In a nutshell, Ewura can be an unhinged and abnormal person...not weird, abnormal (very) but then she's fun to be around. 3na you mortal and "I am the universe". Delusional indeed.</p>
